# Programming-Exercises
Repository full of resent small functions, and their tests.

This includes; code from job interviews, such as the files "NetworkingCompany" and "NetworkingCompany- Review"; and code I have produced as a hobby.

All of the code uses the C++11 standard with the only dependency being the STL library.

# Leetcode Problems
Currently I am working though a curated list of problems from the website LeetCode.

Since I have already familiarised myself with the basics of algorithms (basic data structures and sorting algorithms) I am doing this to practice writing, debugging and optimising basic code, while familiarizing myself with a wider array of algorithms.

My methodology is to tackle the problem unprompted, optimise for time complexity and space complextiy, as measured in big O notation. Once I have a working solution which is as good as I can make it I check the discussions to see how I could have done better.
